**Portable windows application to prevent system from sleeping.**

Inside, it's a simple tray icon, that registers in system as videocontent provider when system should stay awake, and dropping that mode if necessary.

Also, it can start automatically on system start.

Prebuilt binaries available [on releases page](https://github.com/KrusnikViers/WinFreddie/releases).
